    "# Exercise Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Yang Wang (wang701@purdue.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find this instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find it easier to follow and view this instruction on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search `wang701 reeu student` with your favorite search engine and browser.\n",
    "2. Navigate into the github webpage, find the file `aggateway-setup.ipython` and click on it.\n",
    "3. Wait for github to render the python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hang on for a couple of seconds and you will have this set of instructions on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: It is possible that github will have an error for rendering this notebook. Please refresh the page if that's the case.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download our notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the python notebooks in this repo later on to experiment some data and visualize your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using `git`\n",
    " 1. In a directory of your choice, run `git clone https://github.com/wang701/reeu-student.git`\n",
    "* No `git`\n",
    " 1. In `wang701/reeu-student` repo, click on the green button that says **Clone or download**.\n",
    " 2. Click **Download ZIP** to download a whole repo of code as a zip file.\n",
    " 3. Unzip the files to a directory of your choice.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Signup for **Mapbox**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need **Mapbox** for plotting points later on a map so you need to provide your email to sign up for **Mapbox**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your account, you can get a correspondent token from **Mapbox** using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Mapbox**:\n",
    "1. Go to your account.\n",
    "2. Click on **Tokens**.\n",
    "3. You should see a **default public token** listed.\n",
    "![condaMapbox](img/conda_mapbox.png)\n",
    "4. Copy and paste your token string to the **mapbox_token** file in your python notebook directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install and setup Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is an environment that aims to simplify the environment/dependency setup process for Python and R developers. We will use it for our experiments later on because it is relatively easy to configure.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\n",
    "2. Select your operation system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows) and its corresponding installer for your archiecture (32 or 64-bit).\n",
    " * It is recommended that you install a Python 3.x version of Anaconda.\n",
    " * MacOS and Windows have graphical installers. Linux have a really straightforward command line installer.\n",
    "3. Go to https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\n",
    " * Follow your operation system's instructions and install Anaconda using the installers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows: try search and run **Anaconda Navigator** in Start menu. If it runs, then Anaconda is successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* MacOS: try search and run **Anaconda Navigator** from Launchpad. If it runs, then Anaconda is successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linux: try running `conda --version` in your terminal. If Anaconda is successfully installed, then the terminal should give you back the version of your `conda` version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up your own environment \n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely on **Anaconda Navigator** to help you set up your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "After you spin up **Anaconda Navigator**, you will see the following GUI:\n",
    "![aNaviGUI](img/anavi_gui.png)\n",
    "You will mostly interact with the **Home** and the **Environment** tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Home** tab: this tab offers a few selections of commonly used packages and applications for your environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Environment** tab: this tab lets you create new environments or modify existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a new environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on **Environment** tab\n",
    "2. Click on **Create** button\n",
    " * You should be prompted to name your new environment as the following:\n",
    " ![aNaviCreate](img/anavi_create.png)\n",
    " * Name your environment and select the newest Python version for your environment. **We used `aggateway-env` as our environment name for the rest of this document.**\n",
    "3. You will see a loading bar after you hit **Create**.\n",
    "4. After a few seconds, your new environment will be created.\n",
    "5. On the right side, you should be able to see all the default packages that come with your new environment in a auto-populated table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install extra libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install a few extra Python libraries into your new environment. These libraries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[numpy](https://numpy.org/)**: a Python scientific computing library.\n",
    "* **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: a Python data analysis library.\n",
    "* **[plotly](https://plot.ly/)**: a modern data analytics and plotting library.\n",
    "* **[jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)**: a Python notebook tool that allows open access, edits, and visualizations in browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "For installation, you can install all these packages in one single command by opening up a default terminal (**not a terminal in any Anaconda environment**):\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda install jupyter plotly pandas numpy -n aggateway-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace **aggwateway-env** with the name you used for your environment if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should should see something like this after you type in this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done\n",
    "Solving environment: done\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package Plan ##\n",
    "\n",
    "  environment location: /home/yang/.conda/envs/aggateway-env\n",
    "\n",
    "  added / updated specs:\n",
    "    - jupyter\n",
    "    - numpy\n",
    "    - pandas\n",
    "    - plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\n",
    "\n",
    "  attrs              pkgs/main/noarch::attrs-19.2.0-py_0\n",
    "  backcall           pkgs/main/linux-64::backcall-0.1.0-py37_0\n",
    "  blas               pkgs/main/linux-64::blas-1.0-mkl\n",
    "  bleach             pkgs/main/linux-64::bleach-3.1.0-py37_0\n",
    "  dbus               pkgs/main/linux-64::dbus-1.13.6-h746ee38_0\n",
    "  decorator          pkgs/main/linux-64::decorator-4.4.0-py37_1\n",
    "  defusedxml         pkgs/main/noarch::defusedxml-0.6.0-py_0\n",
    "  entrypoints        pkgs/main/linux-64::entrypoints-0.3-py37_0\n",
    "  \n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be prompted for a yes/no question:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Proceed ([y]/n)?\n",
    "```\n",
    "and you will type in `y` to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Preparing transaction: done\n",
    "Verifying transaction: done\n",
    "Executing transaction: done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your command prompt back then congrats, you should have everything installed successfully!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if the packages are correctly in Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the environment you created in the **Environment** tab in Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "2. In the *Search Package* field, type in the name of one of the packages you just installed, i.e., `plotly`:\n",
    "![aNaviGUI](img/anavi_search.png)\n",
    "3. The table should auto-populate the package(s) that is associated with the name you specified. If it doesn't, it means you didn't install the package correctly.\n",
    "4. You can verify the installations of all four extra libraries we installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Play with some data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Run notebook `plot-speed-map-skeleton.ipynb` to visualize some data!"
