    "\n",
    "## Signup for **Mapbox**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need **Mapbox** for plotting points later on a map so you need to provide your email to sign up for **Mapbox**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your account, you can get a correspondent token from **Mapbox** using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Mapbox**:\n",
    "1. Go to your account.\n",
    "2. Click on **Tokens**.\n",
    "3. You should see a **default public token** listed.\n",
    "![condaMapbox](img/conda_mapbox.png)\n",
    "4. Save your token to somewhere safe and easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find this instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find it easier to follow and view this instruction on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search `wang701 reeu student` with your favorite search engine and browser.\n",
    "2. Navigate into the github webpage, find the file `aggateway-setup.ipython` and click on it.\n",
    "3. Wait for github to render the python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hang on for a couple of seconds and you will have this set of instructions on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: It is possible that github will have an error for rendering this notebook. Please refresh the page if that's the case.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download our notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the python notebooks in this repo later on to experiment some data and visualize your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using `git`\n",
    " 1. In a directory of your choice, run `git clone https://github.com/wang701/reeu-student.git`\n",
    "* No `git`\n",
    " 1. In `wang701/reeu-student` repo, click on the green button that says **Clone or download**.\n",
    " 2. Click **Download ZIP** to download a whole repo of code as a zip file.\n",
    " 3. Unzip the files to a directory of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install and setup Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is an environment that aims to simplify the environment/dependency setup process for Python and R developers. We will use it for our experiments later on because it is relatively easy to configure.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\n",
    "2. Select your operation system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows) and its corresponding installer for your archiecture (32 or 64-bit).\n",
    " * It is recommended that you install a Python 3.x version of Anaconda.\n",
    " * MacOS and Windows have graphical installers. Linux have a really straightforward command line installer.\n",
    "3. Go to https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\n",
    " * Follow your operation system's instructions and install Anaconda using the installers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows: try search and run **Anaconda Navigator** in Start menu. If it runs, then Anaconda is successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* MacOS: try search and run **Anaconda Navigator** from Launchpad. If it runs, then Anaconda is successfully installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linux: try running `conda --version` in your terminal. If Anaconda is successfully installed, then the terminal should give you back the version of your `conda` version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up your own environment \n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely on **Anaconda Navigator** to help you set up your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "After you spin up **Anaconda Navigator**, you will see the following GUI:\n",
    "![aNaviGUI](img/anavi_gui.png)\n",
    "You will mostly interact with the **Home** and the **Environment** tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Home** tab: this tab offers a few selections of commonly used packages and applications for your environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Environment** tab: this tab lets you create new environments or modify existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a new environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on **Environment** tab\n",
    "2. Click on **Create** button\n",
    " * You should be prompted to name your new environment as the following:\n",
    " ![aNaviCreate](img/anavi_create.png)\n",
    " * Name your environment and select the newest Python version for your environment.\n",
    "3. You will see a loading bar after you hit **Create**.\n",
    "4. After a few seconds, your new environment will be ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Run notebook `plot-speed-map-skeleton.ipynb` to verify if your environment is properly set up."
